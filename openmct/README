This directory contains files need by your OpenMCT installation that
will expose AIT realtime and historical telemetry endpoints to the
OpenMCT framework.

------------------------

Notes:

- It is assumed that the AitOpenMctPlugin has been activated in the AIT
server configuration file, as this provides the sources for telemetry.
See the local file 'ait_cfg_section.yaml' for the expected section to
be added to your $AIT_CONFIG file.

- For this guide, we also assume that the AIT server is running on
host 'localhost' and port 8082, which are two configuration options
that can be passed to the OpenMct AIT extension during
session setup.

- The AIT extension requires 'http.js', a library that was
included in the OpenMCT Tutorial (Apache License, Version 2.0).
The source location of this file is:
https://github.com/nasa/openmct-tutorial/tree/completed/lib/http.js

------------------------

Setup:

1) Install OpenMCT (https://nasa.github.io/openmct/getting-started/)
We will assume that OpenMCT is installed in a directory referenced
by the environment variable ${OPENMCT_DIR}


2) Copy the downloaded 'http.js' library file to your OpenMCT installation:

> mkdir ${OPENMCT_DIR}/lib
> cp http.js ${OPENMCT_DIR}/lib/


3) Copy the 'ait_integration.js' file to your OpenMCT installation:

> cp ait_integration.js ${OPENMCT_DIR}


4) Edit the existing OpenMCT 'index.html' file to include
references to the 'http.js' and 'ait_integration.js' (prior
to the script tag that initializes OpenMCT):

        <script src="lib/http.js"></script>
        <script src="ait_integration.js"></script>


5) Install AIT extensions to the openmct framework (prior
to the openmct.start() function call):

         openmct.install(AITIntegration({
                 host: 'localhost',
                 port : 8082 }));
         openmct.install(AITHistoricalTelemetryPlugin());
         openmct.install(AITRealtimeTelemetryPlugin());


--------------------------

Running:

1) Start the AIT server (configured to run AIT's OpenMct plugin)
2) Start OpenMCT server.
3) Open browser to location of the OpenMCT UI endpoint.
