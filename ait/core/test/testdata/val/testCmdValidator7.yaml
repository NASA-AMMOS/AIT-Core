    7.2.4.4 Integrated Carrier Smoothing ID 0xa8 (p. 42)

    This command enables the use of accumulated (integrated) carrier
    phase measurements to smooth the code pseudoranges. This smoothes
    some of the noise on the pseudoranges, but does not necessarily
    reduce the offset error sources that affect the pseudoranges
    (e.g. ionospheric errors, ephemeris errors). The centering filter is
    used to centre the smoothed solution at the middle of the
    pseudorange noise, and the recommended value is 25 seconds. The
    smoothing control Byte in the packet allows the filter to be turned
    off without changing the filter parameters.
