  7.2.4.4 Integrated Carrier Smoothing ID 0xa8 (p. 42)

  This command enables the use of accumulated (integrated) carrier
  phase measurements to smooth the code pseudoranges. This smoothes
  some of the noise on the pseudoranges, but does not necessarily
  reduce the offset error sources that affect the pseudoranges
  (e.g. ionospheric errors, ephemeris errors). The centering filter is
  used to centre the smoothed solution at the middle of the
  pseudorange noise, and the recommended value is 25 seconds. The
  smoothing control Byte in the packet allows the filter to be turned
  off without changing the filter parameters.
