# Ignoring:
# E203 prevents flake8 from complaining about whitespace around slice
# components. Black formats per PEP8 and flake8 doesn't like some of
# this.
#
# E501 prevents flake8 from complaining line lengths > 79. We will use
# flake8-bugbear's B950 to handle line length lint errors. This trips
# when a line is > max-line-length + 10%.
#
# E402 prevents flake8 complaining about module level imports not appearing
# at the top of a file. We need to run gevent monkeypatching which triggers
# this on every import where that's the case.

#   B902: Invalid first argument used for method. Use self for instance
#       methods, and cls for class methods
#   B903: Use collections.namedtuple (or typing.NamedTuple) for data classes
#       that only set attributes in an __init__ method, and do nothing else.
#   B950: Line too long. This is a pragmatic equivalent of pycodestyle's
#       E501: it considers "max-line-length" but only triggers when the value
#       has been exceeded by more than 10%.
