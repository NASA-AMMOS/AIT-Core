AMMOS Instrument Toolkit (AIT)
==============================
build test

The AMMOS Instrument Toolkit (Formerly the Bespoke Links to Instruments
for Surface and Space (BLISS)) is a Python-based software suite
developed to handle Ground Data System (GDS), Electronic Ground Support
Equipment (EGSE), commanding, telemetry uplink/downlink, and sequencing
for instrument and CubeSat Missions. It is a generalization and expansion 
of tools developed for a number of ISS
missions.
