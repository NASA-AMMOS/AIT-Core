Introduction to AIT Configuration
=================================

AIT uses a number of `YAML <http://www.yaml.org/start.html>`_ (YAML Ain't Markup Language) and JSON files for project configuration.

You must ensure that the **AIT_CONFIG** environment variable points to your **config.yaml** file in order for AIT to properly configure your project. Given the default AIT project structure you would have the following setup. This assumes you've set **AIT_ROOT** to the project's root directory::

    export AIT_CONFIG=$AIT_ROOT/data/config/config.yaml

What is YAML?
-------------

YAML is a data serialization language with a heavy focus on maintaining human-readability. The `YAML Getting Started <http://www.yaml.org/start.html>`_ provides an overview of the structures supported.

config.yaml
-----------

AIT uses **config.yaml** to load configuration data for the command (cmddict), telemetry (tlmdict), Event Verification Record (evrdict), Binary Stream Capture (bsc), and Logging (logging) components.

* **cmddict**   - defines the location of the Command Dictionary YAML file
* **evrdict**   - defines the location of the Event Verification Record (EVR) Dictionary YAML file
* **tlmdict**   - defines the location of the Telemetry Dictionary YAML file
* **bsc**       - defines the location of the Binary Stream Capture (BSC) YAML configuration file.
* **logging**   - defines the name to be associated with the Logger component (defaults to 'ait') and the host to push the output syslog information (defaults to 'localhost')
* **data**      - specifies all of the data paths associated with the GDS that can further be referenced by AIT or mission-specific tools. The paths specified can use path variables to allow for value substitution based upon date, hostname, platform, or any other configurable variable. See the *ait-create-dirs* tool and *Path Expansion and Variables* section below for more details.

The filename paths should be considered relative to the location of **config.yaml**. If you have **hostname** specific configuration you can add another block of data. The **default** block is the fall back if a match cannot be found. Below is an example **config.yaml** file that defines the default configuration files for AIT.

AIT loads **config.yaml** on import. Here is an example **config.yaml**:

.. code-block:: none

    default:
        command:
            history:
                filename: ../cmdhist.pcap
        sequence:
            directory: ../seq
        cmddict:
            filename:  cmd.yaml

        evrdict:
            filename:  evr.yaml

        tlmdict:
            filename:  tlm.yaml

        bsc:
            filename:  bsc.yaml

        logging:
            name:      ait
            hostname:  yourCustomHostForLogging

        phase: 'dev'

        data:
            '1553':
                path: /gds/${phase}/data/${hostname}/%Y/%Y-%j/downlink/1553
            bad:
                path: /gds/${phase}/data/${hostname}/%Y/%Y-%j/downlink/bad
            lehx:
                path: /gds/${phase}/data/${hostname}/%Y/%Y-%j/downlink/lehx
            planning:
                path: /gds/${phase}/data/${hostname}/%Y/%Y-%j/planning
            sdos:
                path: /gds/${phase}/data/${hostname}/%Y/%Y-%j/sdos
            uplink:
                path: /gds/${phase}/data/${hostname}/%Y/%Y-%j/uplink
            ats:
                path: /gds/${phase}/data/${hostname}/%Y/%Y-%j/ats

        gui:
            port: 8080
            telemetry:
                - stream:
                    name: OCO3_1553_EHS
                    port: 3076
            html:
                directory: ../gui/


If you want to look at the contents of **config.yaml** programmatically you can access it with:

    >>> ait.config
    AitConfig(...)

You can read more about each component's configuration and configuration-schema files in the component-specific pages.


Path Expansion and Variables
----------------------------

File and directory paths included in **config.yaml** can be specified with varying degrees of explicitness in order to allow for the most flexibility. Any file or directory path specified with a key of 'directory', 'file', 'filename', 'path', or 'pathname' will resolve according to the details below.

Absolute Path Expansion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the case where an absolute path is not specified for a 'file', 'filename', 'path', or 'pathname', the following are handled:

* path does not begin with '/' (relative path) - the path or filename given is assumed from the AIT_CONFIG directory.
* path begins with '~' (User HOME directory)   - the current user's home directory is used

Variable Substitution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Variables can also be specified within the path in order to allow for more explicit configuration. The following rules apply:

* Variables are extracted from the keys specified in the **config.yaml**.
* Any variables you would like to access must be at the base-level of the default, host, or platform:
.. code-block:: none

    default:
        phase:      'dev'
        mission:    'oco3'
        instrument: 'pma'

* The variable values must be a string or list of strings:
.. code-block:: none

    default:
        phase:      'dev'
        mission:    'oco3'
        instrument: ['pma', 'icc', 'ecc']

* Variables can be specified in a path using the following syntax
.. code-block:: none

    `${variable}`

    # For example
    path: /${phase}/${mission}/${instrument}

* There are currently 2 default variables whose values are automatically generated, and they can be accessed without specifying them in **config.yaml**.

  * ${year} - current year
  * ${doy}  - current day of year
  * ${hostname} - hostname of machine where AIT is running
  * ${platform} - platform of machine where AIT is running

Example
^^^^^^^

If we have the following specified in **config.yaml**::

    default:
        phase:      'dev'
        mission:    'oco3'
        data:
            data1:
                path: /${phase}/${hostname}/%Y-%j/data1
            data2:
                path: /${phase}/${hostname}/%Y-%j/data2

If the machine hostname = 'oco3-gds1', and today is day 300 in 2016, we can programmatically access these paths:

    >>> for k, v in ait.config._datapaths.items():
    >>>     print "%s - %s" % (k ,v)
    data1 - /dev/oco3-gds1/2016-300/data1
    data2 - /dev/oco3-gds1/2016-300/data2

See **ait-create-dir** software for more details on path substitution and how it can be leveraged.


YAML Idiosyncrasies
-------------------

While YAML is generally very user-friendly, every tool has its rough edges. The AIT team has done its best to help you avoid these where possible. However, it may still be worth investigating potential roadblocks as you use YAML more. There is an excellent resource that the developers at SaltStack have put together on `YAML idosyncrasies <https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/troubleshooting/yaml_idiosyncrasies.html>`_ that is worth reading. It should help you avoid any potential problems in your YAML configuration.
