Telemetry Dictionary Introduction
=================================

AIT provides support for YAML-based configuration of telemetry data within the system. AIT uses a YAML based configuration file to define Packets and their constituent Fields.

.. code-block:: yaml

    - !Packet
      name: CCSDS_HEADER
      fields:
        - !Field
          name:       version
          desc:       Indicates CCSDS Version-1 (does not change)
          bytes:       0
          type:       U8
          mask:       0xE0
        - !Field
          name:       type
          desc:       |
            Distinguishes between core and payload packet types to extend the
            APID space to 4032
          bytes:       0
          type:       U8
          mask:       0x10
          enum:
            0: 'Core'
            1: 'Payload'

All the valid parameters and attributes that can be present in the telemetry dictionary definition are defined in the telemetry schema file. By default this is called *tlm_schema.json* and is located in **ait/core/data/**.  AIT also provides a command line utility for verifying that your telemetry dictionary configuration is valid given that you have a defined schema file. If you pass the ``--tlm`` or ``-t`` flag to ``ait-yaml-validate`` it will check this for you.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ait-yaml-validate --tlm
    016-07-27T09:36:21.408 | INFO     | Validation: SUCCESS: ...

AIT provides telemetry dictionary processing via :class:`ait.core.tlm.TlmDict` which gives a mapping of Packet names and :class:`ait.core.tlm.PacketDefinition` instances.

    >>> import ait.core.tlm
    >>> tlmdict = ait.core.tlm.getDefaultDict()
    >>> type(tlmdict)
    <class 'ait.core.tlm.TlmDict'>
    >>> tlmdict.keys()
    ['Ethernet_HS_Packet', 'CCSDS_HEADER', '1553_HS_Packet']
    >>> type(tlmdict['CCSDS_HEADER'])
    <class 'ait.core.tlm.PacketDefinition'>

We can look at a specific field via a :class:`ait.core.tlm.PacketDefinition`. For instance, we can look at the **version** field from the CCSDS packet defined in `Example Telemetry Packet Definition`

    >>> ccsds_pkt = tlmdict['CCSDS_HEADER']
    >>> ccsds_pkt.fieldmap['version']
    FieldDefinition(bytes=0, desc='CCSDS Version', dntoeu=None, enum=None, expr=None, mask=224, name='version', shift=5, _type=PrimitiveType('U8'), units=None, when=None)


Decoding binary into a :class:`ait.core.tlm.Packet` allows us to easily decode downlink data and check values. Let's look at an example CCSDS Primary Packet Header:

.. code-block:: none

   version:                000                 # Set to '000' per the CCSDS spec
   type:                   0                   # Set per the CCSDS spec
   secondary header flag:  1
   apid:                   01011100111
   sequence flag:          01                  # Indicate this is 'first' segment of a sequence
   sequence count:         00000000000000      # Since it's the first segment, the count is 0
   packet length:          0000010010101111    # '1200' byte packet encoded as 1199 per the CCSDS spec

We'll create a packet from this binary using the CCSDS Primary Packet Header :class:`ait.core.tlm.PacketDefinition` that we were using earlier.

    >>> type(ccsds_pkt)
    <class 'ait.core.tlm.PacketDefinition'>
    >>> data = bytearray(b'\x0A\xE7\x40\x00\x04\xAF')
    >>> pkt = ait.core.tlm.Packet(ccsds_pkt, data=data)

With the :class:`ait.core.tlm.Packet` object we can check each of those values above.

    >>> pkt.version
    0
    >>> pkt.type
    'Core'
    >>> pkt.secondary_header_flag
    'Present'
    >>> pkt.apid
    743
    >>> pkt.sequence_flags
    'First Segment'
    >>> pkt.sequence_count
    0
    >>> pkt.packet_length
    1199

!Packet
-------

The AIT packet constructor is the parent construct for all AIT telemetry packet definitions. It encapsulates high level metadata related to the packet along with all the fields that create the packets structure.

fields:
    A **list** of *!Field* objects that define the structure of the packet.

name (optional):
    A **string** denoting the name of this telemetry packet.

desc (optional):
    A **string** for providing a description of the packet.

constants (optional):
    A **dict** mapping constant names to values to be referenced in the packet and its fields.

    .. code-block:: yaml

       constants:
           A:   371.81
           B:  -4.850e-2
           C:   1.086e-5
           D:  -1.239e-9

functions (optional):
    A **dict** mapping function names to their expressions. Function bodies can reference constants and history values.

    .. code-block:: yaml

       functions:
           R(dn): RL + (dn - history.RT0) * (RH - RL) / (history.RT1 - history.RT0)
           T(dn): A + (B * R(dn)) + (C * R(dn)**2) + (D * R(dn)**3)

    Functions can then be referenced throughout the telemetry definitions. For instance, the following shows the ``T(n)`` function being used as part of a field's ``dntoeu`` attribute:

    .. code-block:: yaml

       - !Field
         name:   RT2
         bytes:  '@prev'
         desc:   Noise source coupler (external) (Assembly Drawing 10335041)
         dntoeu:
           equation: T(raw.RT2)
           units:    Kelvin
           when:     (history.RT1 - history.RT0) > 3000
         type:   LSB_U16
         when:   HKMux1 == 18

    .. warning::

       The intention of the **function** support is not to facilitate embedding scripts into your telemetry dictionary. In general, the above mathematical experssions are what should be expected in function definitions. Of course sometimes you need to access language features or core mathematical functions and you'll need to use the below approach. Just be cautious with how much logic you embed in your telemetry functions and avoid the temptation to move some of your Science Data System processing into your Ground Data System.

    Sometimes you'll need to support more complicated use cases in your functions. If you need to access language features that are more complicated than basic mathematical operators you'll need to take into consideration how the function is handled by the **Core** library and extensions such as the **GUI**. Telemetry functions are processed as Python expressions in **AIT Core** but as Javascript expressions in **AIT GUI**. This can cause problems if you want to embed more complicated functionality. As an example let's add a function that takes 1 or more float values and returns a calculated value.

    .. code-block:: yaml

       - !Field
         name:   Example_Field
         bytes:  MSB_U16
         dntoeu:
           equation: MyComplexFunction(raw.Example_Field, 1.243267047024234, 5.3478290342342342, 72347089237402342)

    We'll need to define **MyComplexFunction** in both Python and Javascript since we're going to need different language features in both. In our project Python package we'll add a **functions.py** file containing the following::

       import math

       def MyComplexFunction(k, *args):
           return sum(a * math.cos(i * math.acos(k)) for i, a in enumerate(args))

    We also need to tell **AIT Core** where to look for our custom function. We can do this by specifying the path to **functions.py** via the **functions** attribute in **Config.yaml**.

    .. code-block:: yaml

       functions:
          myprojectdirectory.functions

    Next we'll define **MyComplexFunction** in Javascript. Let's call this **functions.js** for consistency.

    .. code-block:: javascript

       window.MyComplexFunction = function (k) {
           var sum = 0.0

           for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; ++i) {
               sum += arguments[i] * Math.cos((i - 1) * Math.acos(k))
           }

           return sum
       }

    And we'll add it the GUI's index file. Your path will be different of course!

    .. code-block:: html

       <head>
         <script src="js/functions.js"></script>
       </head>

    Now your function will work as expected in Core and GUI.

history (optional):
    A **list** of *!Field* names for which previous values should be stored. The previous value of a !Field can be reference via ``history.fieldName``.

    .. code-block:: yaml

       history:
           - VX0
           - VX1
           - VX2

derivations (optional):
    A **list** of *!Derivation* definitions that this packet contains. Derived telemetry values are telemetry points derived from other telemetry values. They're handled similarly to *!Field* definitions except they require an **equation** attribute so their value can be calculated. Derived telemetry values are accessed the same way as normal field definitions.

    .. code-block:: yaml

        functions:
           Difference(x,y):  x - y

        derivations:
           - !Derivation
              name: Volt_Diff
              desc: Difference between Voltage_A and Voltage_B
              equation: Difference(Voltage_A, Voltage_B)
              units: Volts
----

!Field
------

name:
    A **string** denoting the name of this field in the packet. Note: Do not use the name "time". "time" is a reserved name used in the backend databases for recording the time of entries. To avoid conflicts of this nature, you should avoid using generic names or prepend names with a subsystem identifier.

type:
    A **string** specifying the data type for the section of the packet in which this field is located. You can see all the valid primitive types that will be accepted here by looking at ``ait.dtype.PrimitiveTypes``. Arrays of types are also supported, e.g. ``MSB_U16[32]``.  You can see examples of how *type* is used in the `Example Telemetry Packet Definition`_ section.

units (optional):
    a **string** specifying the units of the derived field's value.

desc (optional):
    A **string** for providing a description of the field.

mask (optional):
    An integer (usually specified in hexadecimal) specifying the relevant bits of the field's *type* that represents the field's value.

bytes (optional):
    Specifies which byte(s) in the packet make up this field. This can be specified as a single integer or as a list of integers (in the case of a range of bytes). This is a helpful attribute if a field is comprised of a number of bits that do not easily divide into primitive data types. See the *Application Processes Indentifer* in the `Example Telemetry Packet Definition`_ section. If the current **!Field** is a mask of the previous **!Field**'s bytes you can specify that with **'@prev'**.

enum (optional):
    A **dict** of key, value pairs listing the enumeration of values for the field. The **key** matches with the value in the field. The **value** is a **string** describing what the value in the enumeration represents.

dntoeu (optional):
    Specify the equation and units for Data Number to Engineering Unit conversion for the **!Field**.

    .. code-block:: yaml

       dntoeu:
           equation: -4.652 * raw.VX2 / history.VX0
           units:    volts
           when:     history.VX0 > 2000

    The **equation** attribute can also reference a function defined in your telemetry dictionary. See the above *RT2* field definition above as an example.

when (optional):
    An expression defining when a !Field's value is valid.

    .. code-block:: yaml

       when: HKMux1 == 0

    A **when** expression can be set at a **!Field** block level or at a **dntoeu** level as shown in the *RT2* field example above.

    If specified at the **!Field** block level the **when** expression determines when the entire **!Field**'s value is valid. If the **when** expression is true, the Field will have a value, otherwise the field will not have any value.

    If specified at the **dntoeu** level the when expression determines when the DN-to-EU will be run for the field value. If the **when** expression is true, the field's DN-to-EU will be run, otherwise the field will only have a raw value associated with it.


----

!Derivation
-----------

name:
    A **string** denoting the name of this field in the packet.

equation:
    A function defining the value of the derived field.

units (optional):
    a **string** specifying the units of the derived field's value.

desc (optional):
    A **string** for providing a description of the field.

enum (optional):
    A **dict** of key, value pairs listing the enumeration of values for the field. The **key** matches with the value in the field. The **value** is a **string** describing what the value in the enumeration represents.

when (optional):
    An expression defining when a !Derivation's value is valid.

    .. code-block:: yaml

       when: HKMux1 == 0


----

!include
--------

The `include` YAML constructor can be used to pull in a YAML definition from another file.
This can be used to consolidate dictionaries that become to long to manage over time, or to
reuse definitions across various packets. The value for the include can be:

An absolute path:

.. code-block:: yaml

    !include /path/to/my.yaml

or a relative path to the file with the include specified. For instance, if we have a yaml `/path/to/tlm.yaml` with the following:

.. code-block:: yaml

    !include my.yaml

will include `/path/to/my.yaml`.

The included file can include either 1+ Packet definitions or 1+ Field definitions. For instance, both of the following examples are valid.

**Packet !include example**

* header.yaml

  .. code-block:: yaml

      - !Packet
