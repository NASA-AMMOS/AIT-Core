AMMOS Instrument Toolkit (AIT)
==============================

The AMMOS Instrument Toolkit (Formerly the Bespoke Links to Instruments for Surface and Space (BLISS)) 
is a Python-based software suite developed to handle Ground Data System (GDS), 
Electronic Ground Support Equipment (EGSE), commanding, telemetry uplink/downlink, 
and sequencing for JPL International Space Station and CubeSat Missions. 
It is a generalization and expansion of tools developed for a number of JPL ISS missions.
